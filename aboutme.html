        <h4>Saw Fanatic!!</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="intro2">I have been a huuuuuuuuge fan of the Saw films since the first one was released on the 1st October 2004.
        <br>
        <b class="intro2">I mean who doesn't love a bit of gore?!.....and the Saw films are jam packed with it, especially when it comes to the 'traps'.</b></p>
        <p class="intro2">I love how Jigsaw creates these scenarios/traps which are based on his 'subjects' flaws...the way he does this by making a life or death situation fascinates me, it's like a case of 'how much do you value you your life' and 'are you willing to put yourself through extremities to free yourself.'</p>
    </div>

        <h5>My favourite Saw traps.</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="intro2">When it comes to the traps Jigsaw uses for the 'players' of the game, they are definitely awesome. There are a number of traps throughout the Saw franchise and most of them have definitely given me goosebumps and had me glued to the screen.</p>
        <p class="intro2">.....but if i had to choose my top ten, then these would be them:</p>
        <ol id="traps">
            <li>The Pendulum Trap(Saw V)</li>
            <li>The Angel Trap(Saw III)</li>
            <li>The Horsepower Trap(Saw 3D)</li>
            <li>The Classroom Trap(Saw III)</li>
            <li>The Subway Trap(Spiral)<var>Had to include this as it was rather awesome</var></li>
            <li>Pound of Flesh(Saw VI)</li>
            <li>The Rack(Saw III)</li>
            <li>The Furnace(Saw II)</li>
            <li>The Antidote Safe(Saw II)</li>
            <li>Hand Trap(Saw II)</li>
        </ol>

        <h6> Rating of Spiral and Jigsaw</h6>
        <div>
        <img class="image" src="Chris-Rock-Jigsaw-Spiral-feature.jpg" alt="jigsawVspiral">
        </div>
        <p class="intro2">I'll have to admit, I enjoyed both films, they both had their added twists...which was enjoyable. I would have to say I preferred Jigsaw over Spiral</p>
        <p class="intro2">The only reason why, is because it has more of a connection to the previous Saw films....trap wise both were awesome, from the Finger Trap to the Subway Trap(which I absolutely loved)</p>

        <h4>Recommendations for fans of Saw</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p class="intro2">As we know, the Saw franchise is packed with gore....so if you love these films, as much as I do, here are my recommendations:</p>
    <ul class="rec">
        <li>Wolf Creek</li>
        <li>Wolf Creek 2</li>
        <li>The Collector</li>
        <li>The Collection</li>
        <li>Hostel</li>
        <li>Hostel: Part II</li>
        <li>Hostel: Part III</li>
        <li>American Mary</li>
        <li>No One Lives</li>
        <li>You're Next</li>
        <li>I Spit on Your Grave(2010)</li>
        <li>I Spit on Your Grave 2</li>
        <li>I Spit on Your Grave 3:Vengeance Is Mine</li>

    </ul>
    <var class="intro2"> Without a doubt, there are more films, but these are just my all time favourites that I can remember. The I Spit on Your Grave 1, 2 and 3 follow a more of a revenge plot(some scenes are hard to watch, once the 'bad guys' get their comeuppance they are amazing).</var>
