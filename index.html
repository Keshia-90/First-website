        <p class="intro">As many of you may know, the Saw films work around a man, John Kramer a.k.a Jigsaw and his deadly scenarios...or has he calls them, 'tests' or 'games'.</p>
        <p class="intro">After a suicide attempt, John Kramer found a new appreciation for his life. This basically inspired him to give people he selected the same appreciation by testing their will to live. </p>
        <p class="intro">The 'games' he creates for his subjects are based on, what he sees as a flaw in their life or their moral character. This tends to bring up the question 'Is Jigsaw a killer?'.....technically, looking at what he does, he isn't as he 'only puts them in scenarios in which they have to try and avoid death by inflicting physical tortueupon themselves or by killing another participant'. Some people, on the other hand believe that he is a killer as his 'traps' technically cause life threatening injuries or just fully result in death.</p>

        <h3>My opinion on whether Jigsaw and Spiral are a part of the franchise. </h3>
        <img class="gif"src="make-your-choice-jigsaw.gif" alt="decision">
        <p class="op">When it comes to the Jigsaw film....I feel that Jigsaw, compared to Spiral, is more linked towards the other Saw films as our main antagonist, John Kramer makes an appearance....I wont' go into detail about it, but it has a little twist to it, which does make sense in the end.</p>
        <p class="op">Spiral, on the other hand, follows the storyline of a Jigsaw copycat killer...Don't get me wrong, the film itself was good but I think if it was more tied in to Jigsaw and the previous Saw films, it would belong in the franchise...to me it was more of a spin-off. I did find a few of the traps very interesting(the one at the beginning in particular). In comparison to the actual Saw titled films the traps weren't as good when I look back at all the other traps. Despite that the traps did tie into the 'subjects' flaws and 'moral choices'. </p>
